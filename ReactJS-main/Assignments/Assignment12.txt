1. useContext vs Redux.
a] useContext is a hook while Redux is a state management library.
b] useContext is used to share data while Redux is used to manage data and state.
c] useContext is better to use for small applications & Redux for large applications.
d] When using useContext it re-renders all components whenever there is any update in the provider’s value prop while in Redux it only re-render the updated components.
e] By using useContext changes are made with the Context value and using Redux changes are made with pure functions i.e. reducers.


2. Advantages of using Redux toolkit over Redux.
a] RTK gives the ability to write mutable state updates in the reducers.
b] It also eliminates the use of extra coding by providing boilerplates.
c] RTK also has the feature of RTK query which eliminates the use of Thunks and makes the query processing faster
d] It also provides automatic support for Redux Dev-tools Extension and for immer.js library which is a great tool to deal with immutable objects.


3. Explain Dispatcher.
In react-redux the useDispatch hook gives us access to our store's dispatch method. Dispatch is used to send actions into our redux store and is the only way we can affect the store from within a component.


4. Explain Reducer.
In redux, the reducers are the pure functions that contain the logic and calculation that needed to be performed on the state. These functions accept the initial state of the state being used and the action type. It updates the state and responds with the new state. This updated state is sent back to the view components of the react to make the necessary changes.
eg:
reducers : {
	action_name : (state,action) => {
		// code
	}
} 


5. Explain Slice.
A Redux Slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of our app. The name “slice” comes from the idea that we’re splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple “slices” of slate.


6. Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.
createSlice is a function that accepts an object of :
a] Slice name
b] Initial state value
c] Reducers object that contains Reducer functions and its key names will be used to generate actions — these functions intended to handle a specific action type, equivalent to a single case statement in a switch — and each function has a state as the current value in the store and action that will carry the payload for the updated value.
eg:
const sliceName = {
	name : NewSlice,
	initialState: {
		items :[],
	}
	reducers: {
		action_name : (state,action) => {
		// code
	}
} 	
To export the slice - 
export default sliceName.reducer;
To export the actions - 
export const {action_name1, action_name2} =  sliceName.actions;
Now we need to provide the slice to configure the redux store. To do so we use configureStore()
const appStore = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        slice: sliceName,
    },
});
